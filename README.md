Welcome to my **obsidian vault**, this is where I take and organize my notes as I journey through learning computer science. 

## Context
As of starting this vault, I am in the final year of my BSc in Computer Science. However, this vault will not only document my current learning but also integrate knowledge gained throughout my academic journey so far. 

My **goals** with this vault are to :
1. Build a comprehensive, personal knowledge base for computer science.
2. Develop deeper insights by connecting related topics.
3. Track learning progress and revisit challenging concepts.
4. Create a resource I can rely on for future reference.

## Structure
I use folders to separate notes into categories and tags for more specific subcategories. Changes in my notes are pushed automatically every 15 min.
