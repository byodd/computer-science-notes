Offensive security represents the process where you simulate a hacker's actions to find vulnerabilities in a system.

**Gobuster** is a free and open-source directory and file enumeration tool. Penetration testers and security professionals use it to find hidden directories and files on web servers.

Example:
```shell
gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir
```
In the command above, `-u` is used to state the website we're scanning, `-w` takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages.
