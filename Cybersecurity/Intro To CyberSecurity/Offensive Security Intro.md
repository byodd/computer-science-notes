Offensive security represents the process where you simulate a hacker's actions to find vulnerabilities in a system.

It aims to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities to enhance security measures.Â This includes exploiting software bugs, leveraging insecure setups, and taking advantage of unenforced access control policies, among other strategies. Red teams and penetration testers specialize in these offensive techniques.

# Practical case
**Gobuster** is a free and open-source directory and file enumeration tool. Penetration testers and security professionals use it to find hidden directories and files on web servers.

Example:
```shell
gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir
```

> In the command above, `-u` is used to state the website we're scanning, `-w` takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages.
