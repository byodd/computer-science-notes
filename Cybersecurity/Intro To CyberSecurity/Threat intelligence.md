In the context of [[Security Operations Center (SOC)]], _intelligence_ refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies. A _threat_ is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system.

Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries. The purpose would be to achieve a _threat-informed defence_.

**Intelligence needs data**. Data has to be collected, processed, and analyzed. Data is collected from local sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums. Data processing arranges it into a format suitable for analysis.

Learning about your adversaries lets you know their tactics, techniques, and procedures. As a result of threat intelligence, we identify the threat actor (adversary) and predict their activity. Consequently, we can mitigate their attacks and prepare a response strategy.
