Defensive security have 2 main tasks:
1. Preventing intrusions from occurring
2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

# Tasks related to defensive security
- User cyber security awareness
- Documenting and managing assets
- Updating and patching systems:
- Setting up preventative security devices using firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). 
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices

> [!info]
> **Firewalls** control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. 
> 
> **IPS** (Intrusion Prevention Systems) blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.

# Areas of DefSec
- [[Security Operations Center (SOC)]]
- [[Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)]]

# Practical case
_Security Information and Event Management_Â (SIEM) is a system used to aggregate security information in the form of logs, alerts, artifacts and events into a centralized platform that would allow security analysts to perform near real-time analysis during security monitoring.

There are many open-source databases out there, like AbuseIPDB, and Cisco Talos Intelligence, where you can perform a reputation and location check for an IP address. Most security analysts use these tools to aid them with alert investigations.
